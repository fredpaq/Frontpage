 Gatsby Babylon.js
 Gatsby Babylon.js starter

Kick off your project with this Babylon.js minimum scene boilerplate. This is built on top of Gatsby's default starter and everything that is included there is also here.
ðŸš€ Quick start

    Create a Gatsby-Babylonjs site.

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-babylon-starter https://github.com/creationspirit/gatsby-babylonjs-starter

    Start developing.

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    cd my-babylon-starter/
    gatsby develop

    Open the source code and start editing!

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial.

    Open the my-babylon-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/scene.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
